## 1. Goals as a developer : I would like to participate in the development to prove this theory.

## 2. My hypothesis on the ai algorithm : All human words and actions result in "self-satisfied".


<br>

Around 2021-2022, I suddenly realized something.
In order to create an artificial intelligence that behaves and speaks exactly like a human, at the end of the algorithm, 'Are you self-satisfied?' as a conditional statement.
Then all rational and irrational behaviors of human beings can be explained.

<br>

- ex 1. Volunteering is an act of altruism, but in the end it is an action for myself.
  - Volunteering -> I am proud of helping others -> It is an action for myself. -> self-satisfaction

<br>

- ex 2. Violence inflicted on someone is also an action for me.
  - Violence is used (there is no reason for being beaten, not justified, or due to any lack) -> Self-satisfaction by relieving stress, relieving oppressed pressure, etc.

<br>

- ex 3. If you look at many parents raising children, there are two types. But this is all due to self-satisfaction.
  - Type 1) "I need some care for my child"
    - They care about their children (acting out of the hope that their children will grow up well) -> Parents themselves are satisfied.

  -Type 2) "I don't care about the child. The child will grow up alone." (It's just a difference from Type 1.
    - They don't care about their children. (As expected, they act out of the hope that their children will grow up well) -> Parents themselves are satisfied.

<br>

In this way, all human words and actions result in "self-satisfied".
This is the conclusion of my hypothesis. If you want to create an artificial intelligence just like a human, you must pass “Are you satisfied with yourself?” at the end of the AI code.
